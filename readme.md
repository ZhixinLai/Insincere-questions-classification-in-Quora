# background
In kaggle, Quora Insincere Questions Classification aims at labeling insincere questions, which are founded upon false premises or intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers. It is a sentence-level classification task.

In the competition, 1306122 training data and 56370 test data are provided. In training set, 6.2% of the training data are insincere questions and the rest are sincere questions. We divide training set into two parts, 90% for the and training 10% for the validation. We program from the aspects of sentence preprocess, transmission from word to vector, training model and prediction. We apply different models and compare the results of different models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and then we add the Bidirectional way in Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We also blend different models together with the methods of Linear Regression and feedforward neural network. Besides, in order to improve accuracy, we introduce Attention Mechanism and combine four embeddings in the process of transforming world to vector. We selected the best model and got the public F1 score 0:695 with the highest score of 0:711. Finally, we draw some conclusions about comparison of different models and effectiveness of attention mechanism and embeddings combination.
